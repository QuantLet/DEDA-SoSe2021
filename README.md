# Digital Economy and Decision Analytics class Summer Term 2021

The repository contains the codes of final projects of DEDA Summer Term 2021 class @ HU zu Berlin

* Each group should for the following repository and create the folder for their own final project.
* One project = one Quantlet 
* The code of each Quantlet needs to be accompanied by the Metainfo.txt file (it is just a textual configuration file that needs to contain specific info and **lies in the same folder as your Quantlet's main script**). We put _metainfo.txt in each project's folder, please fill out with the respective information and change the name to metainfo.txt (remove the underscore in the front)
* This metainfo files are needed to create the README in the LvB style automatically. Please, do not try to create the README by yourself - it will be done automatically.
* The main idea of these Quantlets is that anyone can reproduce your research.
* Please make sure that the main script of your Quantlet has the same name as the one you specified in the Metainfo.txt file. (E.g. if your Quantlet Name is bitcoinVolatilityCheck - the main script will have a name bitcoinVolatilityCheck.py (.ipynb or .r etc. - depending on what language you use))





* To have more information on how to create a Quantlet, please refer to the Styleguide of Quantlet:
