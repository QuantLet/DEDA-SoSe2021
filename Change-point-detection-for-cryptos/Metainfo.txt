Name of Quantlet: 'CPD'

Published in: 'DEDA class of summer term 2021'

Description: 'We perform a sequential non-parametric change point detection method in distribution for BTC and ETH, individually. Then, we apply the PCA on both time series and use the same method to find change points. A sensitivity analysis is conducted, showing that the number of estimated change points reduces as we decrease the starting period, as well as when we increase the ARL. '

Keywords: 'change point detection, non-parametric, Cramer von Mises Test, change in distribution, PCA'
